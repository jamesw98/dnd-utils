    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        This site is the second version of a little side project that's turned less little the more I work on it. It started because a DM friend asked if I could write a program that could help automate some DM tools he had in Excel. I wrote it in Python and thought "Huh, this could be a cool little web app".
