Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.\nYou can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.\nOnce the jug starts producing a liquid, it can\u0027t produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.\n\n\nLiquid\nMax Amount\n\n\nAcid\n8 ounces\n\n\nBasic poison\n1/2 ounce\n\n\nBeer\n4 gallons\n\n\nHoney\n1 gallon\n\n\nMayonnaise\n2 gallons\n\n\nOil\n1 quart\n\n\nVinegar\n2 gallons\n\n\nWater, fresh\n8 gallons\n\n\nWater, salt\n12 gallons\n\n\nWine\n1 gallon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":false}
