{"Id":717,"Name":"Axe of the Dwarvish Lords","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWeapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement)\nSeeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.\nVenturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\nArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\nLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\nMagic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a Belt of Dwarvenkind, a Dwarven Thrower, and a Sword of Sharpness.\nRandom Properties. The axe has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n2 minor beneficial properties\n1 major beneficial property\n2 minor detrimental properties\n\nBlessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYou have immunity to poison damage.\nThe range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.\nYou gain proficiency with artisan\u0027s tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.\n\nConjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the Conjure Elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can\u0027t use this property again until the next dawn.\nTravel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can\u0027t use this property again until 3 days have passed.\nCurse. The axe bears a curse that affects any nondwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature\u0027s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren\u0027t considered magical in nature (and therefore can\u0027t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a Greater Restoration or Remove Curse spell.\nDestroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":true}
