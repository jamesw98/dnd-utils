As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don\u0027t hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Waterdeep - Dragon Heist","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
