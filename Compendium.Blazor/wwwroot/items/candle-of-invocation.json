{"Id":488,"Name":"Candle of Invocation","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity\u0027s alignment. The candle\u0027s alignment can be detected with the Detect Good and Evil spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.\n\n\nd20\nAlignment\n\n\n1-2\nChaotic evil\n\n\n3-4\nChaotic neutral\n\n\n5-7\nChaotic good\n\n\n8-9\nNeutral evil\n\n\n10-11\nNeutral\n\n\n12-13\nNeutral good\n\n\n14-15\nLawful evil\n\n\n16-17\nLawful neutral\n\n\n18-20\nLawful good\n\n\nThe candle\u0027s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle\u0027s total burn time.\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle\u0027s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell\u0027s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the Gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
