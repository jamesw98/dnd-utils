{"Id":300,"Name":"Chromatic Rose","PageContent":"\n\nSource: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight\nWondrous Item, Rare\nThis magic rose comes in one of five colors, as noted in the Chromatic Roses table. While a rose is held, it gains a harmless visual effect as indicated on the table.\nWhile holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to damage of the type associated with the rose\u0027s color. If you would take more than 10 damage of this type from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.\nAs an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid, lightning, poisonous gas, fire, or cold, as dictated by the rose\u0027s damage type. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 damage of the appropriate type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.\n\n\nChromatic Roses\n\n\nColor\nVisual Effect\nDamage Type\n\n\nBlack\nDrips acid\nAcid\n\n\nBlue\nCrackles with lightning\nLightning\n\n\nGreen\nIssues green gas\nPoison\n\n\nRed\nWreathed in fire\nFire\n\n\nWhite\nCovered with frost\nCold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"The Wild Beyond The Witchlight","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
