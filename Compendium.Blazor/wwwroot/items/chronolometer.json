At the start of your turn, roll a d6 (no action required). On a 1-3, you slow down time, gaining an additional action on your turn and doubling your speed until the end of the turn. On a 4-6, you go forward in time to warn yourself of what is to come. The next time you fail a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can reroll the check and take either result. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.\nFate Swap. As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, that creature gains an additional action if it is the creature\u0027s turn, or can take an action immediately even though it isn\u0027t the creature\u0027s turn.
