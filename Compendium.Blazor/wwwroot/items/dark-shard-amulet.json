{"Id":17,"Name":"Dark Shard Amulet","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything\nWondrous item, common (requires attunement by a warlock)\nThis amulet is fashioned from a single shard of resilient extraplanar material originating from the realm of your warlock patron. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYou can use the amulet as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\n\n\nYou can try to cast a cantrip that you don\u0027t know. The cantrip must be on the Warlock spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can\u0027t use this property again until you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":true}
