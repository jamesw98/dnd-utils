As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.\nWhen you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d6 psychic damage and become frightened of you until the start of your next turn.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
