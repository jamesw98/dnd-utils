As a bonus action, you can use the gauntlets to cause magical flames to envelop one or two melee weapons in your grasp. Each flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used, this property can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Baldur\u0027s Gate - Descent into Avernus","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
