When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you\u0027re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 \u002B your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
