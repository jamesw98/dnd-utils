{"Id":342,"Name":"Gulthias Staff","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Curse of Strahd\nStaff, rare (requires attunement)\nMade from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 \u002B 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.\nIf the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.\nVampiric Strike. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff\u0027s pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short-term madness (see \u0026quot;Madness\u0026quot; in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide).\nBlight Bane. While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don\u0027t regard you as hostile unless you harm them.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Curse of Strahd","Type":"staff","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
