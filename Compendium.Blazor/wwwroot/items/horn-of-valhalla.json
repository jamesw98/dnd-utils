In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics from the Monster Manual. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can\u0027t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nFour types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn\u0027s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn\u0027s type or determines it randomly.\n\n\nd100\nHorn Type\nBerserkers Summoned\nRequirement\n\n\n01-40\nSilver\n2d4 \u002B 2\nNone\n\n\n41-75\nBrass\n3d4 \u002B 3\nProficiency with all simple weapons\n\n\n76-90\nBronze\n4d4 \u002B 4\nProficiency with all medium armor\n\n\n91-00\nIron\n5d4 \u002B 5\nProficiency with all martial weapons\n\n\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.
