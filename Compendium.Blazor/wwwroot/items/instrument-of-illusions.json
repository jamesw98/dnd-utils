If you are a bard, the radius increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":true}
