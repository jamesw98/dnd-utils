{"Id":647,"Name":"Instrument of the Bards","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement by a bard)\nAn instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can\u0027t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\n\nInstrument\nRarity\nSpells\n\n\nAll\n-\nFly, Invisibility, Levitate, Protection from Evil and Good, plus the spells listed for the particular instrument\n\n\nAnstruth harp\nVery rare\nControl Weather, Cure Wounds (5th level), Wall of Thorns\n\n\nCanaith mandolin\nRare\nCure Wounds (3rd level), Dispel Magic, Protection from Energy (lightning only)\n\n\nCli lyre\nRare\nStone Shape, Wall of Fire, Wind Wall\n\n\nDoss lute\nUncommon\nAnimal Friendship, Protection from Energy (fire only), Protection from Poison\n\n\nFochlucan bandore\nUncommon\nEntangle, Faerie Fire, Shillelagh, Speak with Animals\n\n\nMac-Fuirmidh cittern\nUncommon\nBarkskin, Cure Wounds, Fog Cloud\n\n\nOllamh harp\nLegendary\nConfusion, Control Weather, Fire Storm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rarity varies","RequiresAttunment":true}
