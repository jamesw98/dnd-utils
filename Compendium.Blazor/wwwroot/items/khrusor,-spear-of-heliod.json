In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it\u0027s typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.\nSpear of the Sun. This spear grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.\nBlessing of the Sun. If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:\n\nPiety 3\u002B. You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.\nPiety 10\u002B. The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.\nPiety 25\u002B. The spear has 1 additional randomly determined minor beneficial property.\nPiety 50\u002B. The spear has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.\nSee \u0026quot;Artifacts\u0026quot; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.\nLuminous. The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.\nSun\u0027s Retaliation. When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nSpells. The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: Guiding Bolt (1 charge), Daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), Sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn.\nDestroying the Spear. If taken to Erebos\u0027s palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos\u0027s service.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Mythic Odysseys of Theros","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":true}
