The scepter has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 \u002B 4 expended charges at dawn. Its properties are as follows:\n\nIf you are underground or underwater, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to determine the distance to the surface.\nAs an action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Sending spell from the scepter.\nAs an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the Teleport spell from the scepter.
