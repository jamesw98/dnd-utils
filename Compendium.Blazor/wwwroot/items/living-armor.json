The armor can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it, and you can\u0027t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you\u0027re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the armor ends, and it detaches from you.\nThe armor requires fresh blood be fed to it. Immediately after you finish any long rest, you must either feed half of your remaining Hit Dice to the armor (round up) or take 1 level of exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"armor","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
