The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can\u0027t use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\n\n\nd20\nGolem\nTime\nCost\n\n\n1-5\nClay\n30 days\n65,000 gp\n\n\n6-17\nFlesh\n60 days\n50,000 gp\n\n\n18\nIron\n120 days\n100,000 gp\n\n\n19-20\nStone\n90 days\n80,000 gp\n\n\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.\nOnce you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands. See the Monster Manual for its game statistics.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
