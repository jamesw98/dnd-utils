{"Id":539,"Name":"Mirror of Reflected Pasts","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen\nWondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)\nThis mirror of elven design allows those who stare into it to reflect on positive memories. The 3-foot-tall mirror weighs 25 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.\nWhile holding the mirror upright, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. While activated, the mirror hovers in the air, and it can be destroyed but not moved. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again or your attunement to the mirror ends, at which the mirror harmlessly floats to the ground. Once the mirror has been deactivated, it can\u0027t be activated again until the next dawn.\nIf a non-Construct creature other than you sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed until the mirror is deactivated or until the creature can no longer see the mirror. A creature paralyzed by the mirror can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature\u0027s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this mirror\u0027s effect for the next 24 hours.\nWhile paralyzed by the mirror, the creature sees events from their past reflected in the mirror\u0027s glass. These memories aren\u0027t real, but rather idealized versions of those occurrences. Nearby observers can glimpse flashes of these memories if looking indirectly at the mirror.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dragonlance","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
