{"Id":367,"Name":"Mirror of the Past","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal\nWondrous item, rare\nThe holder of this platinum hand mirror can learn something about the history of a specific object or creature by taking an action to gaze into the mirror and think of the target. Instead of the holder\u0027s reflection, the mirror presents scenes from the target\u0027s past. Information conveyed is accurate, but it is random and cryptic, and presented in no particular order. Once it is activated, the mirror gives its information for 1 minute or less, then returns to normal. It can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tales from the Yawning Portal","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
