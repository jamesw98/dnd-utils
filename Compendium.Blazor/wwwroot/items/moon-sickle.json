The bonus is determined by the weapon\u0027s rarity. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.\nWhen you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":false}
