It takes 30 days of concentrated study\u2014at least 8 hours per day\u2014to attempt to understand this scroll. After completing this study, you must make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If this check fails, you take 16d10 psychic damage, and you can attempt the check again after another 30 days of concentrated study.\nWhen you succeed on the check, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYour Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Once you gain this benefit, you can\u0027t use this scroll to increase your Intelligence again.\nYou gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nWhen you gain the scroll\u0027s benefits, a stone golem magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you and acts as your ally. If you die, the golem turns to dust.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Candlekeep Mysteries","Type":"scroll","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
