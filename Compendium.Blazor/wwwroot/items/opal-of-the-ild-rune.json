{"Id":376,"Name":"Opal of the Ild Rune","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Storm King\u0027s Thunder\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis triangular fire opal measures about three inches on each side and is half an inch thick. The ild (fire) rune shimmers within its core, causing it to be slightly warm to the touch. The opal has the following properties, which work only while it\u0027s on your person.\nIgnite. As an action, you can ignite an object within 10 feet of you. The object must be flammable, and the fire starts in a circle no larger than 1 foot in diameter.\nFire\u0027s Friend. You have resistance to cold damage.\nFire Tamer. As an action, you can extinguish any open flame within 10 feet of you. You choose how much fire to extinguish in that radius.\nGift of Flame. You can transfer the opal\u0027s magic to a nonmagical item \u0026#8212; a weapon or a suit of armor \u0026#8212; by tracing the ild rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the opal is destroyed, and the rune appears in red on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:\n\nWeapon. The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.\nArmor. The armor is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. You have resistance to cold damage while wearing the armor.\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Storm King\u0027s Thunder","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
