If you already have darkvision, the orb increases its range by 60 feet.\nYou have advantage on Wisdom checks to find hidden doors and paths.\n\nCurse. The orb is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times.
