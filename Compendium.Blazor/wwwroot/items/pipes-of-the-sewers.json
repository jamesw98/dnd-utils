{"Id":189,"Name":"Pipes of the Sewers","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren\u0027t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren\u0027t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn\u0027t under another creature\u0027s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm\u0027s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0027t be swayed by the pipes\u0027 music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes\u0027 music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can\u0027t hear the pipes\u0027 music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\u0027t be swayed by the pipes\u0027 music for the next 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
