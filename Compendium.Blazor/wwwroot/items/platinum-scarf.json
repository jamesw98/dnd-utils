{"Id":665,"Name":"Platinum Scarf","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Fizban\u0027s Treasury of Dragons\nWondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)\nThis scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.\nAs an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:\nBreath of Life. The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains 10d4 hit points.\nPlatinum Shield. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a \u002B1 shield, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.\nRadiant Hammer. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.\nOnce three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don\u2019t speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Fizban\u0027s Treasury of Dragons","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
