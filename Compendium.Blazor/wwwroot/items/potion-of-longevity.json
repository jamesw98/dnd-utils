Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 \u002B 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion\u0027s tail, an adder\u0027s fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"potion","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
