{"Id":203,"Name":"Pyroconverger","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Guildmaster\u0027s Guide to Ravnica\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nA pyroconverger is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.\nAs an action, you can cause the pyroconverger to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nEach time you use the pyroconverger, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the pyroconverger malfunctions: you take 4d6 fire damage, and you can\u0027t use the pyroconverger again until you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Guildmaster\u0027s Guide to Ravnica","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
