{"Id":222,"Name":"Seeker Dart","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse\nWeapon (dart), uncommon\nThis small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft.\nWhen you whisper the word \u201Cseek\u201D and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don\u2019t need to see it now. If the target isn\u2019t within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.\nWhen the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage. The dart\u2019s magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Princes of the Apocalypse","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":false}
