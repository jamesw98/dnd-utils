{"Id":423,"Name":"Shadowfell Shard","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)\nThis dull, cold crystal sits heavy and leaden, saturated by the Shadowfell\u0027s despair. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.\nWhen you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
