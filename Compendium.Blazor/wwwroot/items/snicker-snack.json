{"Id":687,"Name":"Snicker-Snack","PageContent":"\n\nSource: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight\nWeapon (Greatsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Non-evil Creature)\nYou gain a \u002B3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.\nWhen you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature\u0027s heads. The creature dies if it can\u0027t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn\u0027t have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\nWhile attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.\nSentience. Snicker-Snack is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. Snicker-Snack craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.\nSnicker-Snack has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword\u0027s trust by making a contested Charisma check against Snicker-Snack. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can\u0027t be restored in any other way.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"The Wild Beyond The Witchlight","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
