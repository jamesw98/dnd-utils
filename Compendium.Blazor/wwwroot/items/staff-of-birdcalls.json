While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch\u0027s chirp, a raven\u0027s caw, a duck\u0027s quack, a chicken\u0027s cluck, a goose\u0027s honk, a loon\u0027s call, a turkey\u0027s gobble, a seagull\u0027s cry, an owl\u0027s hoot, or an eagle\u0027s shriek.\nThe staff regains 1d6 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"staff","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":false}
