{"Id":741,"Name":"Staff of the Forgotten One","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation\nStaff, artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\nThis crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten archmage whom Acererak destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull\u0027s forehead is Accrerak\u0027s rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.\nBeneficial Properties. While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYour proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled.\nYou can\u0027t be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned.\nUndead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.\nYou can wield the staff as a \u002B3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.\n\nInvoke Curse. The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can\u0027t regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A Greater Restoration, Remove Curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target.\nThe Forgotten One. The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff\u0027s skull protects Acererak from this spirit\u0027s vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff\u0027s charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM\u0027s control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a Dispel Evil and Good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff.\nDestroying the Staff. A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone\u0027s guess.\nCasting the staff into a Sphere of Annihilation destroys both the staff and the Life force trapped within it. The staff doesn\u0027t explode if destroyed in this manner, but its destruction causes the sphere to be destroyed as well.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tomb of Annihilation","Type":"staff","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":true}
