While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to east one of the following spells from it: speak with animals (2 charges), speak with dead (4 charges), or speak with plants (3 charges).\nWhen you cast a divination spell, you can use the crystal in place of one material component that would normally be consumed by the spell, at a cost of 1 charge per level of the spell. The crystal is not consumed when used in this way.\nThe crystal regains 1d6 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the crystal\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal vanishes, lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Out of the Abyss","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
