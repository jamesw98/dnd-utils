When it reaches that point, the weapon vanishes in an explosion, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, you can use an action to cause the weapon to reappear in your empty hand. You can\u0027t cause it to explode again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you don\u0027t call the weapon back to your hand, it reappears at the point where it exploded when you are no longer attuned to it or when 24 hours have passed.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Guildmaster\u0027s Guide to Ravnica","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
