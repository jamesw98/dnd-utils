This sword is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.\nIn addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can\u0027t reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.\nYou can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the sword forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The sword then becomes a \u002B1 weapon with no other properties.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
