{"Id":747,"Name":"The Infernal Machine Of Lum The Mad","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Infernal Machine Rebuild\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nThis strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft\u2019s central command console.\nExplorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum\u2019s eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\nSilver Wire. The Infernal Machine\u2019s great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine\u2019s inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an Astral Projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine\u2019s powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut \u0026#8212; something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an Astral Projection\u0027s silvery cord \u0026#8212; the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine\u2019s effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user\u2019s spell save DC, whichever is higher.\nSummon Monster. When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\n\n1/day: Conjure Animals, Summon Lesser Demons\n1/7 days: Conjure Minor Elemental, Conjure Woodland Being, Summon Greater Demon\n1/month: Conjure Elemental, Conjure Fey\n\nWish. The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a Wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month.\nEach time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days\u2019 worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\nRandom Properties. There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine\u2019s controls than can ever be known or matrixed \u0026#8212; especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 \u002B 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 \u002B 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user\u2019s next long rest.\n(Our thanks to the D\u0026amp;D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\nDestroying the Machine. The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum\u2019s time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings \u0026#8212; and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.\n\n\nInfernal Machine Properties\n\n\nd100\nBeneficial Property\nDetrimental Property\n\n\n01\nYou have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement.\nYou are blinded.\n\n\n02\nYou can cast the Speak with Animals spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice.\nAll animals despise you.
