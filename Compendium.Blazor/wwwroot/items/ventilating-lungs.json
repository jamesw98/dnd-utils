{"Id":448,"Name":"Ventilating Lungs","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Eberron - Rising from the Last War\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThese metallic nodules were created in response to the poisonous gases used on the battlefields of the Last War. When you attune to these lungs, they replace the lungs in your chest, which disappear. The lungs allow you to breathe normally, even in an antimagic field, and their breathing function can\u0027t be suppressed by magic.\nOutside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum), and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those created by a Cloudkill spell, a Stinking Cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and gaseous breath weapons .\nAs an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the Gust of Wind spell (spell save DC 15) with no components. This property of the lungs can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nIf your attunement to the lungs ends, your original lungs reappear.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
