{"Id":83,"Name":"Wand of Conducting","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything\nWand, common\nThis wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.\nThe wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles to dust and is destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"wand","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":false}
