{"Id":750,"Name":"Wyrmskull Throne","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Storm King\u0027s Thunder\nWondrous item, artifact\nBuilt by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire, the Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet \u0026#8212; the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne\u0027s powers are activated.\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton\u0027s throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne\u0027s power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton\u0027s leadership.\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can\u0027t be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic \u0026#8212; the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne\u0027s master.\nProperties of the Throne. The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne\u0027s properties, which are as follows:\n\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn\u0027t expend any charges.\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn\u0027t expend any charges.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast Lightning Bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne\u0027s blue dragon skulls.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the Globe of Invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature\u0027s turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature\u0027s choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon\u0027s bite and claw attacks.\n\nDestroying the Throne. The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can\u0027t be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne\u0027s destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Storm King\u0027s Thunder","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":false}
