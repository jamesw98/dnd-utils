Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.\nThe spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn\u2019t transported.
