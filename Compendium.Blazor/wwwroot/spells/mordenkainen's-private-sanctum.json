The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\nSound can\u2019t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.\nThe barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.\nSensors created by divination spells can\u2019t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\nCreatures in the area can\u2019t be targeted by divination spells.\nNothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\nPlanar travel is blocked within the warded area.\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\nSpell Lists.
