Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.\nA nonmagical object that isn\u2019t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it\u2019s in the spell\u2019s area.\nAt Higher Levels.
