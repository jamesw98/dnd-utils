        <b>Who?</b>

    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        I'm Jimmy, I'm a software engineer and massive D&D nerd. I'm primarily a backend engineer working on C# .NET products, which is why I chose Blazor WASM for this project.

        Currently I'm the only code contributor, but I've gotten lots of great input from my D&D group. If you'd like to view the code, check it out <u><a href="https://github.com/jamesw98/dnd-utils">here</a></u>.

        <b>What?</b>
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        This project is made to make DM-ing (and eventually playing) D&D easier. It helps automate a lot of the tedious tasks that come along with being a Dungeon Master.

    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Also, the quotes seen above on this page are from a long running campaign I'm in, there'll most likelly be new additions after every session :)

        <b>Why?</b>
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        A DM friend asked if I could write a program that could help automate some DM tools he had in Excel. I wrote it in Python and thought "Huh, this could be a cool little web app".
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        I chose Blazor WASM since another major side project I'm working on is already using Blazor ServerSide, so this was reletively easy to pick up.
