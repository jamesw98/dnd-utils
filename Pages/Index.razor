    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        This site is a little side project that's turned less little the more I work on it. It started because a DM friend asked if I could write a program that could help automate some DM tools he had in Excel. I wrote it in Python and thought "Huh, this could be a cool little web app".

        The site's name sake (Skim Beeble) is a favorite NPC of the D&D group I am a part of. The quotes a the top of the page are various quotes from our sessions.
