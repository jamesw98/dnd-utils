{"Id":606,"Name":"Apparatus of Kwalish","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\nThe apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n\nArmor Class: 20\n\n\nHit Points: 200\n\n\nSpeed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft., (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren\u0027t extended)\n\n\nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic\n\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus\u0027s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus\u0027s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.\n\n\n\nApparatus of Kwalish Levers\n\n\n\nLever\nUp\nDown\n\n\n1\nLegs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.\nLegs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus\u0027s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.\n\n\n2\nForward window shutter opens.\nForward window shutter closes.\n\n\n3\nSide window shutters open (two per side).\nSide window shutters close (two per side).\n\n\n4\nTwo claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.\nThe claws retract.\n\n\n5\nEach extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: \u002B8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
