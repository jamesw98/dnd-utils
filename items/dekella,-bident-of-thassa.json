{"Id":723,"Name":"Dekella, Bident of Thassa","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Mythic Odysseys of Theros\nWeapon (trident), artifact (requires attunement)\nThassa wields Dekella, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Purphoros. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it\u0027s often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she\u0027d prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities.\nBident of the Deep. Thassa\u0027s signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.\nBlessing of the Deep. If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:\n\nPiety 10\u002B. You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.\nPiety 25\u002B. The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.\nPiety 50\u002B. The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.\nSee \u0026quot;Artifacts\u0026quot; in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.\nCommand the Deep. The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see \u0026quot;Weather at Sea\u0026quot; in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can\u0027t be used again until the next dusk.\nAdditionally, you can cast the Dominate Monster spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can\u0027t be used again until the next dusk.\nAquatic Metamorphosis. You can cast the True Polymorph spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can\u0027t be used again until the next dusk.\nDestroying the Bident. To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Mythic Odysseys of Theros","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":true}
