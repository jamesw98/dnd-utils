{"Id":348,"Name":"Hook of Fisher\u0027s Delight","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Icewind Dale - Rime of the Frostmaiden\nWondrous item, rare\nThis tiny silver fishhook has a little gold feather attached to it. For it to function, the feathered hook must be tied to the end of a fishing line and immersed in enough water to fill at least a 10-foot cube. At the end of each uninterrupted hour of immersion, roll a d6. On a 6, a floppy, 6-inch-long magical fish appears on the end of the hook. The color and properties of the conjured fish are determined by rolling on the Hook of Fisher\u0027s Delight table. Once the hook conjures a fish, it can\u0027t do so again until the next dawn.\n\n\nHook of Fisher\u0027s Delight\n\n\nd20\nFish Color\nMagical Property\n\n\n1-10\nGreen with copper bands\nThis tasty fish provides a day\u0027s worth of nourishment to one creature that eats it.
