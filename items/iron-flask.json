{"Id":649,"Name":"Iron Flask","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask\u0027s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you\u0027re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn\u0027t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn\u0027t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask\u0027s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn Identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.\n\n\nd100\nContents\n\n\n01-50\nEmpty\n\n\n51\nArcanaloth\n\n\n52\nCambion\n\n\n53-54\nDao\n\n\n55-57\nDemon (type 1)\n\n\n58-60\nDemon (type 2)\n\n\n61-62\nDemon (type 3)\n\n\n63-64\nDemon (type 4)\n\n\n65\nDemon (type 5)\n\n\n66\nDemon (type 6)\n\n\n67\nDeva\n\n\n68-69\nDevil (greater)\n\n\n70-72\nDevil (lesser)\n\n\n73-74\nDjinni\n\n\n75-76\nEfreeti\n\n\n77-78\nElemental (any)\n\n\n79\nGithyanki knight\n\n\n80\nGithzerai zerith\n\n\n81-82\nInvisible stalker\n\n\n83-84\nMarid\n\n\n85-86\nMezzoloth\n\n\n87-88\nNight hag\n\n\n89-90\nNycaloth\n\n\n91\nPlanetar\n\n\n92-93\nSalamander\n\n\n94-95\nSlaad (any)\n\n\n96\nSolar\n\n\n97-98\nSuccubus/incubus\n\n\n99\nUltroloth\n\n\n00\nXorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
