{"Id":739,"Name":"Ruinstone","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Divine Contention\nWondrous item, artifact\nA fiery red crystal the size of a human palm.\nOnce per day as a bonus action, a villain can activate the ruinstone to undo one deed they have performed. The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it\u2019s simplest to allow them the opportunity to \u201Crewind\u201D one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions).\nEach use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: someone known to the wielder is also erased from reality. After the villain uses the ruinstone, roll a d20: on a 5-20, one of their allies disintegrates, on an 1-4, one of the player characters disintegrates.\nIf a creature bound its soul to the ruinstone in the \u201CThalivar\u2019s Beacon\u201D quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates, disappearing from reality and can only be brought back with a wish spell, or similar magic.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Divine Contention","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"artifact","RequiresAttunment":false}
