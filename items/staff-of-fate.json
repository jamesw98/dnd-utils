The staff has 6 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the staff\u0027s charges to give yourself or one other creature that you can see a d4. The recipient can roll this d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. If this extra die is not used before then, it is lost.\nIf you expend the staff\u0027s last charge, roll a d20.
