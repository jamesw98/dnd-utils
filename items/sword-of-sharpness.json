{"Id":594,"Name":"Sword of Sharpness","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWeapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.\nWhen you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20 you lop off one of the target\u0027s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.\nIn addition, you can speak the sword\u0027s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
