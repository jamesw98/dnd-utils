{"Id":706,"Name":"Vorpal Sword","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWeapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a \u002B3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.\nWhen you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature\u0027s heads. The creature dies if it can\u0027t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn\u0027t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":true}
