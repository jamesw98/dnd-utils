{"Id":455,"Name":"Wand of Paralysis","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nThis wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target\u0027s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe wand regains 1d6 \u002B 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wand","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
