Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points of fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the on you\u2019re on, the target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to the plane you\u2019re on, the creature vanishes into a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nSpell Lists.
