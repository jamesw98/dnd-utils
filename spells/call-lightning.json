{"Id":219,"Name":"Call Lightning","School":"conjuration","Level":3,"PageContent":"Source: Player\u0027s Handbook\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can\u2019t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can\u2019t accommodate the cloud).\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d10.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.\nSpell Lists.
