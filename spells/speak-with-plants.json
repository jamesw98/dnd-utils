Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM\u2019s discretion. The spell doesn\u2019t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you share a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\nSpell Lists.
