To attune to this item, you must wear it on your head for the entire attunement period, during which the crown\u0027s hidden tendrils burrow into your scalp to bond with your skull.\nWhile wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nSpells. The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): Charm Person (1 charge), Disintegrate (6 charges), Fear (3 charges), Finger of Death (7 charges), Flesh to Stone (6 charges), Hold Person (2 charges), Ray of Enfeeblement (2 charges), Sleep (1 charge), Slow (3 charges), Telekinesis (5 charges).\nThe crown regains 1d6 \u002B 3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nSymbiotic Nature. The crown can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it, and you can\u0027t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you\u0027re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you.\nThe daelkyr Belashyrra made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":true}
