{"Id":109,"Name":"Bottled Breath","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse\nPotion, uncommon\nThis bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.\nIf you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the Gust of Wind spell. If you hold the breath, you don\u2019t need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn\u2019t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Princes of the Apocalypse","Type":"potion","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":false}
