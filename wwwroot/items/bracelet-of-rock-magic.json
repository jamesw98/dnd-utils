{"Id":487,"Name":"Bracelet of Rock Magic","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this gold bracelet, it grants you immunity to being petrified, and it allows you to cast Flesh to Stone (save DC 15) as an action. Once the spell has been cast three times, the bracelet can no longer cast it. Thereafter, you can cast Stone Shape as an action. After you have done this thirteen times, the bracelet loses its magic and turns from gold to lead.\nCurse. The bracelet\u0027s affinity with earth manifests as an unusual curse. Creatures of flesh that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against Flesh to Stone cast from the bracelet. If such a creature\u0027s save is successful, the bracelet breaks your attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are petrified instantly.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tales from the Yawning Portal","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
