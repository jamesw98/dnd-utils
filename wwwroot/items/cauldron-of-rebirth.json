{"Id":490,"Name":"Cauldron of Rebirth","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)\nThis Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spell casting focus for your druid spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the Scrying spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a Potion of Greater Healing. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.\nAs an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can\u0027t fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.\nIf you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by Raise Dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can\u0027t be used again for 7 days.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Tasha\u0027s Cauldron of Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
