{"Id":493,"Name":"Conch of Teleportation","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Storm King\u0027s Thunder\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis item is an ordinary, albeit rather large, conch shell that has been inscribed with the uvar rune. The conch measures 2\u0026#160;1/2 feet long and weighs 20 pounds.\nAs an action, you can cast the Teleport spell by blowing into the shell. The destination is fixed, and there is no chance of either a mishap or the spell being off target. Anyone teleported by the conch appears in a specific location designated by the item\u0027s creator at the time the uvar rune is inscribed on the conch. It doesn\u0027t allow teleportation to any other destination. Once its spell is cast, the conch can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Storm King\u0027s Thunder","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
