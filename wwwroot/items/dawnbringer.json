Once used, this ability can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nSentience. Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nThe sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you\u0027re attuned to it.\nPersonality. Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.\nLong years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Out of the Abyss","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":true}
