{"Id":122,"Name":"Deck of Illusions","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can\u0027t be used again.\n\n\nPlaying Card\nIllusion\n\n\nAce of hearts\nRed dragon\n\n\nKing of hearts\nKnight and four guards\n\n\nQueen of hearts\nSuccubus or incubus\n\n\nJack of hearts\nDruid\n\n\nTen of hearts\nCloud giant\n\n\nNine of hearts\nEttin\n\n\nEight of hearts\nBugbear\n\n\nTwo of hearts\nGoblin\n\n\nAce of diamonds\nBeholder\n\n\nKing of diamonds\nArchmage and mage apprentice\n\n\nQueen of diamonds\nNight hag\n\n\nJack of diamonds\nAssassin\n\n\nTen of diamonds\nFire giant\n\n\nNine of diamonds\nOgre mage\n\n\nEight of diamonds\nGnoll\n\n\nTwo of diamonds\nKobold\n\n\nAce of spaces\nLich\n\n\nKing of spaces\nPriest and two acolytes\n\n\nQueen of spaces\nMedusa\n\n\nJack of spaces\nVeteran\n\n\nTen of spaces\nFrost giant\n\n\nNine of spaces\nTroll\n\n\nEight of spaces\nHobgoblin\n\n\nTwo of spaces\nGoblin\n\n\nAce of clubs\nIron golem\n\n\nKing of clubs\nBandit captain and three bandits\n\n\nQueen of clubs\nErinyes\n\n\nJack of clubs\nBerserker\n\n\nTen of clubs\nHill giant\n\n\nNine of clubs\nOgre\n\n\nEight of clubs\nOrc\n\n\nTwo of clubs\nKobold\n\n\nJokers (2)\nYou (the deck\u0027s owner)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":false}
