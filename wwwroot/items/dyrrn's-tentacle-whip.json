{"Id":509,"Name":"Dyrrn\u0027s Tentacle Whip","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Eberron - Rising from the Last War\nWeapon (whip), very rare (requires attunement)\nThis long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for the entire attunement period, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.\nYou gain a \u002B2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.\nAs a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of\nyour arm again.\nSymbiotic Nature. The whip can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it, and you can\u0027t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you\u0027re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
