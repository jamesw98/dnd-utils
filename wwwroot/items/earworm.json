{"Id":133,"Name":"Earworm","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Eberron - Rising from the Last War\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nTo attune to this symbiont, you must hold it against the skin behind your ear for the entire attunement period, whereupon it burrows into your head and bonds to your skull. While the earworm is inside you, you can speak, read, and write Deep Speech.\nSpells. The earworm has 4 charges. You can cast the following spells from it, expending the necessary number of charges (spell save DC 15): Detect Thoughts (2 charges) or Dissonant Whispers (1 charge). Each time you use the earworm to cast the Detect Thought spell, it sends the information gleaned to the nearest daelkyr, or to the next nearest earworm until it reaches a daelkyr.\nThe earworm regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.\nSymbiotic Nature. The earworm can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it, and you can\u0027t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you\u0027re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the earworm ends, and it exits your body.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
