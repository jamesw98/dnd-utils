It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.\nYou can use an action to unfold and place the Hammock of Worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user\u0027s choice). You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once the Hammock of Worlds has opened a portal, it can\u0027t do so again for 1d8 hours.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Journeys through the Radiant Citadel","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
