While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits:\n\nYou can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n\nYou can try to cast a cantrip that you don\u0027t know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can\u0027t use this property again until you finish a long rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":true}
