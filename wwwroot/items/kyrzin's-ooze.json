{"Id":529,"Name":"Kyrzin\u0027s Ooze","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Eberron - Rising from the Last War\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis opalescent, symbiotic goo comes sealed in a jar and slowly shifts and moves, as if endlessly exploring the jar\u0027s interior. To attune to this item, you must first drink the contents of the jar, unlocking the following properties.\nResistant. While attuned to Kyrzin\u0027s ooze, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you\u0027re immune to the poisoned condition.\nAmorphous. As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you\u0027re wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nAcid Breath. As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nSymbiotic Nature. The ooze can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it, and you can\u0027t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you\u0027re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.\nIf you die while the ooze is inside you, it bursts out and engulfs you, turning your corpse into a black pudding allied with the daelkyr (see the Monster Manual for the black pudding\u0027s stat block).\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"very rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
