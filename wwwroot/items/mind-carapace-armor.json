Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls. While worn by any other creature, the mind carapace armor functions as normal armor of its kind. To its intended wearer, the armor grants advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and makes its wearer immune to the frightened condition.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Volo\u0027s Guide to Monsters","Type":"armor","Rarity":"uncommon","RequiresAttunment":true}
