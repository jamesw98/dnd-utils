The front of the shield is sculpted to depict a grieving human face.\nYou gain a \u002B1 bonus to AC for every two allies within 5 feet of you (up to a maximum of \u002B3) while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield\u0027s normal bonus to AC.\nWhen a creature you can see within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. When you do so, the damage type changes to force.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Guildmaster\u0027s Guide to Ravnica","Type":"armor","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
