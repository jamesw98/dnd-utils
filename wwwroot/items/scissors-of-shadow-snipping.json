{"Id":418,"Name":"Scissors of Shadow Snipping","PageContent":"\n\nSource: The Wild Beyond The Witchlight\nWondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Fey or a Spellcaster)\nAs an action, you make a few snips with these iron shears and cause the shadow of a Humanoid creature you can see within 5 feet of you to detach from its source. If the creature is unwilling to give up its shadow, it can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, retaining its shadow on a success. Whether or not the shadow is snipped, this property of the scissors can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\nThe detached shadow is rooted to the spot where it was snipped until you use a bonus action to cause it to behave in one of the following ways, either of which is possible only if you can see the shadow:\n\nYou control the shadow\u0027s movements and can make the shadow move up to 30 feet across a solid or liquid surface, in any direction you choose (including along vertical surfaces), provided it remains within your sight at all times. The shadow is harmless and unable to be harmed, and it is invisible in darkness. It can\u0027t speak, and it doesn\u0027t require air, sleep, or nourishment.\nYou can relinquish control of the shadow, at which point it becomes autonomous and behaves as the DM wishes. It uses the shadow stat block in the Monster Manual, but its creature type is Fey instead of Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by this shadow\u0027s Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and all its Strength after finishing a short or long rest.\n\nA creature whose shadow has detached from it is cursed. If a shadowless creature is subjected to any spell that ends a curse, or if its detached shadow is reduced to 0 hit points, the detached shadow disappears, and the creature regains its normal shadow instantly.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"The Wild Beyond The Witchlight","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
