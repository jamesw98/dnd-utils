For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder.\nThe cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends.\nA creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"scroll","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":false}
