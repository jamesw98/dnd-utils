{"Id":691,"Name":"Spell Scroll","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide\nScroll, rarity varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class\u2019s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell\u2019s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your class\u0027s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 \u002B the spell\u0027s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nOnce the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell\u0027s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll\u0027s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\n\n\nSpell Scroll\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Level\nRarity\nSave DC\nAttack Bonus\n\n\nCantrip\nCommon\n13\n\u002B5\n\n\n1st\nCommon\n13\n\u002B5\n\n\n2nd\nUncommon\n13\n\u002B5\n\n\n3rd\nUncommon\n15\n\u002B7\n\n\n4th\nRare\n15\n\u002B7\n\n\n5th\nRare\n17\n\u002B9\n\n\n6th\nVery rare\n17\n\u002B9\n\n\n7th\nVery rare\n18\n\u002B10\n\n\n8th\nVery rare\n18\n\u002B10\n\n\n9th\nLegendary\n19\n\u002B11\n\n\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 \u002B the spell\u0027s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"scroll","Rarity":"rarity varies","RequiresAttunment":false}
