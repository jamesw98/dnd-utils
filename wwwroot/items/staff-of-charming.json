The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.\nIf you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you , you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can\u0027t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment that targets only you, with or without the staff\u0027s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\nThe staff regains 1d8 \u002B 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide","Type":"staff","Rarity":"rare","RequiresAttunment":true}
