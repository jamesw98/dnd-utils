{"Id":74,"Name":"Staff of Flowers","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything\nStaff, common\nThis wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.\nThe staff regains 1d6 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"staff","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":false}
