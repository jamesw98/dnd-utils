{"Id":695,"Name":"Sunsword","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Curse of Strahd\nWeapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)\nThe Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd\u0027s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.\nStrahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei\u0027s death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice\u0027s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire\u0027s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.\nThe hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a Sun Blade.\nSentience. The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.\nPersonality. The Sunsword\u0027s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Curse of Strahd","Type":"weapon","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":true}
