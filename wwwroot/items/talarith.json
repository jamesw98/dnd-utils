{"Id":697,"Name":"Talarith","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo\u0027s Astral Menagerie\nWondrous item, Legendary (Usable Only by the Reigar Who Created It)\nThe reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the talarith, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits.\nAs an action, a reigar can use its talarith to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar\u0027s commands and uses the reigar\u0027s statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn\u0027t have a talarith of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Spelljammer","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"legendary","RequiresAttunment":false}
