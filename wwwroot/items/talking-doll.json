For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, \u0026quot;I want a piece of candy.\u0026quot; The doll\u0027s phrases are lost when your attunement to the doll ends.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Xanathar\u0027s Guide to Everything","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":true}
