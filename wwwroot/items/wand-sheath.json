{"Id":87,"Name":"Wand Sheath","PageContent":"\n\nSource: Eberron - Rising from the Last War\nWondrous item, common (requires attunement by a warforged)\nA wand sheath clamps onto your arm and imparts the following benefits:\n\nThe wand sheath can\u0027t be removed from you while you\u0027re attuned to it.\nYou can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. The sheath can hold only one wand at a time.\nYou can retract or extend a wand from the sheath as a bonus action. While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free.\n\nIf a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, your attunement to the wand ends.\n\n\n\n\n","Source":"Eberron - Rising from the Last War","Type":"wondrous item","Rarity":"common","RequiresAttunment":true}
