{"Name":"Animal Shapes","School":"transmutation","Level":8,"PageContent":"Source: Player\u0027s Handbook\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 24 hours\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your actions to transform affected creatures into new forms.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target\u2019s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit point it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconcious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t speak or cast spells.\nThe target\u2019s gear melds into the new form. The target can\u2019t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nSpell Lists.
