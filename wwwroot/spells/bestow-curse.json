When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:\n\nChoose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.\n\n\nWhile cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\n\n\nWhile cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.\n\n\nWhile the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.\n\nA remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM\u0027s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse\u0027s effect.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.
