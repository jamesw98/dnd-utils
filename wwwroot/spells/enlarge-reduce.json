Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.\nIf the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.\nEnlarge. The target\u2019s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category \u2013 from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn\u2019t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target\u2019s attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage.\nReduce. The target\u2019s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category \u2013 from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\u2019s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u2019t reduce the damage below 1).\nSpell Lists.
