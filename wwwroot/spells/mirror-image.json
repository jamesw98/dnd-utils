Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it\u2019s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell\u2019s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack\u2019s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate\u2019s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can\u2019t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\nSpell Lists.
