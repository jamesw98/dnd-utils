{"Name":"Polymorph","School":"transmutation","Level":4,"PageContent":"Source: Player\u0027s Handbook\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u2019s (or the target\u2019s level, if it doesn\u2019t have a challenge rating). The target\u2019s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target\u2019s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u2019t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. This spell can\u2019t affect a target that has 0 hit points.\nSpell Lists.
