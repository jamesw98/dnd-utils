When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can\u2019t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by the divination of spells.\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn\u2019t grow older.\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include \u0026quot;after 1,000 years\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;when the tarrasque awakes.\u0026quot; This spells also ends if the target takes any damage.\nSpell Lists.
