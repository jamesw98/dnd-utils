The corpse must still have a mouth and can\u2019t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn\u2019t return the creature\u2019s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can\u2019t learn new information, doesn\u2019t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can\u2019t speculate about future events.\nSpell Lists.
