It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Fiendish Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature resembles a fiend of the chosen type, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell\u2019s level appears in the stat block.\nSpell Lists.
